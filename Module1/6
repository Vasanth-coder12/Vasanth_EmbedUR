In the assesment question the Output is 8 



similarly,for

#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int A;
    char B;
    char C;
    char D,n,m;
} InfoData;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Calculate size of structure
    printf("\n Size of Structure = %d\n\n", sizeof(InfoData));
    return 0;
}

here we can see that the output is 12 but the size of char is 1 byte and int is 4 byte 
therefore 4+1+1+1+1+1 = 9 but is padded to the mutiple of 4bytes 12 as it is the highest byte size.
